# Traveling Salesman Problem Visualization

## Method & Purpose

This visualization was made using the Matplotlib Animation tool in Python. It examines all permutations of Hamiltonian cycles/tours in any given graph it simulates. I made this 
program to give a visual example of the brute force/naive method to solving the TSP. This brute force algorithm runs in O(n!) time.

## Usage

To view this program on your own, you will need a code editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code is reccomended if you don't have one).
Next, download the files by pressing the <> Code button on GitHub and then Download. 
Next, unzip the download and then open [tsp_visualization.py](travelling_salesman_visualization/tsp_visualization.py) in VSCode. 
Ensure you have the packages installed on your computer that are shown in the [requirements.txt](travelling_salesman_visualization/requirements.txt) file, 
as well as [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Finally, press the play/run button in VSCode.

You should now see a new window pop up with the visualization running! Feel free to use the Cities slider to change the number of cities, and the Frames Per Update can be increased
to slow down the animation, or decreased to speed it up.
